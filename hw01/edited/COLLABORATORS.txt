I spent 17+ hours on this assignment (7 on Prob. 1 and 10+ on Prob. 2)

I read through Stanford CS 229 (ML) course materials and went over the provided materials for this class
which took roughly 10 hours.

I spent a lot of time in jupyter notebooks learning numpy and googling on stackoverflow about how to
manipulate data structures, etc.

For implementation details, the following sites helped a lot:
