Welcome to the starter code repository for project C.

## Instructions for Project C

<https://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/135/2020f/projectC.html>

## Contents

Dataset:

* [data_movie_lens_100k](https://github.com/tufts-ml-courses/comp135-20f-assignments/tree/master/projectC/data_movie_lens_100k)

See the README there for documentation

Demo code to load the dataset into tuples of NumPy arrays:

* [train_valid_test_loader.py](https://github.com/tufts-ml-courses/comp135-20f-assignments/blob/master/projectC/train_valid_test_loader.py)

Files you need to edit, which define the various models we use in Project C

* M1: CollabFilterMeanOnly.py
* M2: CollabFilterOneScalarPerItem.py
* M3: CollabFilterOneVectorPerItem.py

Files you should not edit, that contain SGD code for training models:

* [AbstractBaseCollabFilterSGD.py](https://github.com/tufts-ml-courses/comp135-20f-assignments/blob/master/projectC/AbstractBaseCollabFilterSGD.py)

Demo code on using third-party library "surprise" for the open ended task in Problem 4

* [surprise_demo.py](https://github.com/tufts-ml-courses/comp135-20f-assignments/blob/master/projectC/surprise_demo.py)
